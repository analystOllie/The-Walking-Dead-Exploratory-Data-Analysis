## Data Source
For this analysis I used dataset [The Walking Dead Episodes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bcruise/the-walking-dead-episodes/data) (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through [Bill Cruise](https://www.kaggle.com/bcruise)).  

This dataset has data about all 177 episodes. Dataset has total two **.csv** files. Both of these files has some common data in them but also  some differenies.

### Episodes
First file is **the_walking_dead_episodes.csv** this file has total **eight** columns.

| **Column #**   | **Column Name**   | **Description**   | **Column #**    | **Column Name**    | **Description**   |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **0** | season | season | **4** | directed_by | director(s) of the episode |
| **1** | episode_num_in_season | episode number in season | **5** | written_by | writter(s) of the episode |
| **2** | episode_num_overall | episode number in series | **6** | original_air_date | original air date |
| **3** | title | title of the episode | **7** | us_viewers | US viewers on original air date |

### IMDB
Second files is **the_walking_dead_imdb.csv** this file has less columns than previous, just **seven**.

| **Column #**   | **Column Name**   | **Description**   | **Column #**    | **Column Name**    | **Description**   |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **0** | season | season | **4** | imdb_rating | average IMDB rating |
| **1** | episode_num_in_season | episode number in season | **5** | total_votes | total number of votes that <br>the IMDB rating was based on |
| **2** | title | title of the episode | **6** | desc | episode synopsis |
| **3** | original_air_date | original air date |  |  |  |

## Analysis
Before I started with analysis in Python I took a peek at both files in Excel. Because both files has almost same structure and share majority of columns I diceded to merge these two files into before diving into analysis.  
  
### Importing libraries
I start my analysis by importing libraries of Python packages for needs of my analysis.
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
from scipy.stats import kruskal
```

### Preparing dataset
Then I loaded both files into dataframes.
```python
episodes = pd.read_csv('the_walking_dead_episodes.csv')
imdb = pd.read_csv('the_walking_dead_imdb.csv')
```
With both files successfuly loaded I merged them into one dataset that I will be using for rest of the analysis.
```python
twd_dataset = pd.merge(episodes, imdb)
```
After I merged both files into one dataset I check created dataset if everything is like it should be.
```python
print(twd_dataset.shape)
```
```
Output:
(177,12)
```
```python
twd_dataset.head()
```
```
Output:
| season | episode_num_in_season | episode_num_overall | title                | directed_by           | written_by                                  | original_air_date | us_viewers  | episode_num | imdb_rating | total_votes | desc                                              |

```
Dataset now has **177 rows** and **12 columns**. Number of rows is correct but when it comes to columns noticed that there was one column twice but with different naming. These two columns were `episode_num_in_season` and `episode_num`. Both of them had same meaning so I decide to drop one of them to keep my dataset clean.
```python
twd_dataset = twd_dataset.drop(['episode_num'], axis= 'columns')
```
I checked again shape of the dataset to make sure all changes were applied.
```python
twd_dataset.shape
```
```
Output:
(177, 11)
```
Also I renamed column `desc` which has synopsis of episode to `episode_synopsis` for much clearer naming.
```python
twd_dataset.rename(columns = {'desc': 'episode_synopsis'}, inplace = True)
```
### Looking at the dataset
At this moment dataset was ready so I took a step and looked at dataste more closely. First of all I check some basic informations about dataset.
```python
```
