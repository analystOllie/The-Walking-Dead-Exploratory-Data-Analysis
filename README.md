## Data Source
For this analysis I used dataset [The Walking Dead Episodes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bcruise/the-walking-dead-episodes/data) (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through [Bill Cruise](https://www.kaggle.com/bcruise)).  

This dataset has data about all 177 episodes. Dataset has total two **.csv** files. Both of these files has some common data in them but also  some differenies.

### Episodes
First file is **the_walking_dead_episodes.csv** this file has total **eight** columns.

| **Column #**   | **Column Name**       | **Description**          | **Column #**    | **Column Name**    | **Description**                 |

## Data Cleaning And Preparation
Before I started with analysis in Python I took a peek at both files in Excel. Because both files has almost same structure and share majority of columns I diceded to merge these two files into before diving into analysis.<br>
  
### Importing Libraries
I start my analysis by importing libraries of Python packages for needs of my analysis.
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
from scipy.stats import kruskal
```

### Preparing Dataset
Then I loaded both files into dataframes.
```python
episodes = pd.read_csv('the_walking_dead_episodes.csv')
imdb = pd.read_csv('the_walking_dead_imdb.csv')
```
With both files successfuly loaded I merged them into one dataset that I will be using for rest of the analysis.
```python
twd_dataset = pd.merge(episodes, imdb)
```
After I merged both files into one dataset I check created dataset if everything is like it should be.
```python
print(twd_dataset.shape)

Output:
(177,12)
```
```python
twd_dataset.head()

Output:
| season | episode_num_in_season | episode_num_overall | title                | directed_by           | written_by                                  | original_air_date | us_viewers  | episode_num | imdb_rating | total_votes | desc                                              |

```
Dataset now has **177 rows** and **12 columns**. Number of rows is correct but when it comes to columns noticed that there was one column twice but with different naming. These two columns were `episode_num_in_season` and `episode_num`. Both of them had same meaning so I decide to drop one of them to keep my dataset clean.
```python
twd_dataset = twd_dataset.drop(['episode_num'], axis= 'columns')
```
I checked again shape of the dataset to make sure all changes were applied and column was removed.
```python
twd_dataset.shape

Output:
(177, 11)
```
```python
twd_dataset.head()

Output:
| season | episode_num_in_season | episode_num_overall | title                | directed_by           | written_by                                  | original_air_date | us_viewers  | imdb_rating | total_votes | desc                                              |

```
Also I renamed column `desc` which has synopsis of episode to `episode_synopsis` for much clearer naming.
```python
twd_dataset.rename(columns = {'desc': 'episode_synopsis'}, inplace = True)
```
### Observing And Cleaning
At this moment dataset was ready so I took a step and looked at dataste more closely. First of all I check some basic informations about dataset.
```python
twd_dataset

Output:
| season | episode_num_in_season | episode_num_overall | title                | directed_by           | written_by                                           | original_air_date | us_viewers  | episode_num | imdb_rating | total_votes | episode_synopsis                                      |

**Key Takeaways:**  
- dataset has **177 rows** and **11 columns**
- **non** of the columns has **empty fields**
- `original_air_date` and `us_viewers` has **wrong data types**
```python
twd_dataset.duplicated().sum()

Output:

```
**Key Takeaways:**  
- seasons are from **1** to **11**
- episdoes are from **1** to **177**
- average US viewers, IMDB rating and total votes will be **analyzed more in depth later**
```python
display(twd_dataset.describe(include = 'object'))

```
**Key Takeaways:**  
**_Please Note:_**  
Later I discovered that names of some directors are not cleaned so take this part as initial look at data not final conclusion.
- **Greg Nicotero** directed most episodes
- **Angela Kang** wrote most episodes
```python
twd_dataset.isnull().apply(pd.Series.value_counts)

Output:
| season | episode_num_in_season | episode_num_overall | title | directed_by | written_by | original_air_date | us_viewers  | episode_num | imdb_rating | total_votes | episode_synopsis |
|--------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------|-------------|------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| False  | 177                   | 177                 | 177   | 177         | 177        | 177               | 177         | 177         | 177         | 177         | 177              |
```
**Key Takeaway:**  
- **non** of the columns has missing values
```python
twd_dataset.isna().apply(pd.Series.value_counts)

Output:
| season | episode_num_in_season | episode_num_overall | title | directed_by | written_by | original_air_date | us_viewers  | imdb_rating | total_votes | episode_synopsis |
|--------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------|-------------|------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|

```
**Key Takeaway:**  
- **non** of the columns has NaN values
  
As I mentioned above columns `original_air_date` and `us_viewers` has a wrong data types. So I decide to chang `original_air_date` from `object`  to `datetime64[ns]` and `us_viewers` to `int`.
```python
twd_dataset['us_viewers'] = twd_dataset['us_viewers'].astype('int')
twd_dataset['original_air_date'] = pd.to_datetime(twd_dataset['original_air_date'])
```
```python
twd_dataset.dtypes

Output:
season                            int64
episode_num_in_season             int64
episode_num_overall               int64
title                            object
directed_by                      object
written_by                       object
original_air_date        datetime64[ns]
us_viewers                        int64
imdb_rating                     float64
total_votes                       int64
episode_synopsis                 object
dtype: object
```
Before I moved to some actual analysis lastly I looked at what values are stored in columns and also checked how many values are unique so I woudn't japerdise analysis by skipping this important step. I used **for** loop to get info about all colums.  
**_Please Note:_**  
I didn't include output of this code because it's too long, but I will provide my findings.
```python
cols = twd_dataset.columns.tolist()

for stat in cols:
  print(stat)
  print(twd_dataset[stat].unique())
  print('Number of unique: ' + str(twd_dataset[stat].nunique()))
  print('\n')
```
**Key Takeaways:**
- there are **11** unique seasons
- **24** unique episode numbers
- **177** unique overall episodes
- **177** unique titles
- **55** directors (with one badly formatted row)
- **69** writters (**9** that needs to be **corrected**)
- incosistent using of **"&"** and **"and"** in `directed_by` and `written_by ` column
- **176** unique dates I had to check it but it's correct because epsides **2x8** and **2x9** aired at **same day**
- **162** unique numbers of viewers
- **35** unique IDMB average ratings
- **176** different vote counts
- and as last **177** unique synopsis

So some things needed to be updated and changed to make this dataset ready to use. Firstly I fixed inconsistent usage of "&" and "and" at rows where episode was written by **more than one** writer.
```python
twd_dataset['written_by'].replace('&', 'and', inplace = True, regex = True)
```
Second thing that need to be fixed was one value in `diredted_by` where names were separated with **"space"** so I changed that to **"and"**.
```python
twd_dataset.loc[twd_dataset['directed_by'] == 'Ernest DickersonGwyneth Horder-Payton', 'directed_by'] = 'Ernest Dickerson and Gwyneth Horder-Payton'
```
Here I noticed that person named **"David Leslie Johnson"** sometimes appears as **"David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick"** so I make sure to fix this along with all faulty "&" and "and" usage in `written_by` column.
```python
twd_dataset.loc[twd_dataset['written_by'] == 'David Leslie Johnson', 'written_by'] = 'David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick'

twd_dataset.loc[twd_dataset['written_by'] == 'Teleplay by: Frank Darabont', 'written_by'] = 'Frank Darabont'
twd_dataset.loc[twd_dataset['written_by'] == 'Story by: Angela KangTeleplay by: Corey Reed and Jim Barnes', 'written_by'] = 'Angela Kang and Corey Reed and Jim Barnes'
twd_dataset.loc[twd_dataset['written_by'] == 'Story by: Charles H. Eglee and Jack LoGiudiceTeleplay by: Charles H. Eglee and Jack LoGiudice and Frank Darabont', 'written_by'] = 'Charles H. Eglee and Jack LoGiudice and Frank Darabont'
twd_dataset.loc[twd_dataset['written_by'] == 'Story by: Corey ReedTeleplay by: Corey Reed and Kevin Deiboldt', 'written_by'] = 'Corey Reed and Kevin Deiboldt'
twd_dataset.loc[twd_dataset['written_by'] == 'Story by: Jim Barnes and Eli Jorn√© and Corey ReedTeleplay by: Corey Reed', 'written_by'] = 'Jim Barnes and Eli Jorn√© and Corey Reed'
twd_dataset.loc[twd_dataset['written_by'] == 'Story by: Scott M. Gimple and Channing PowellTeleplay by: Channing Powell', 'written_by'] = 'Scott M. Gimple and Channing Powell'
twd_dataset.loc[twd_dataset['written_by'] == 'Story by: Scott M. Gimple and David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Angela KangTeleplay by: David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Angela Kang', 'written_by'] = 'Scott M. Gimple and David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Angela Kang'
twd_dataset.loc[twd_dataset['written_by'] == 'Story by: Scott M. Gimple and Matthew NegreteTeleplay by: Matthew Negrete', 'written_by'] = 'Scott M. Gimple and Matthew Negrete'
```
After this step number of **directors** changed from **57** to **55** and number of **writers** chnged from **69** to **67**. Dataset was finally complete and clean so I saved it before moving on. 
```python
twd_dataset.to_csv('TWD_dataset.csv', encoding = 'utf-8', index = False)
```
At this point I did everything with data in phase of preparing data for analysis. So let's move on to some **REAL** analysis stuff.ü¶∏
